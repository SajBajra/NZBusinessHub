Ajax Duplicate Alert add-on checks several different fields of new listings in real-time against those already in the database.

== Description ==

= Keep your database clean and free from duplicate entries =

The Ajax Duplicate Alert add-on checks several different fields of new listings in real-time against those already in the database. If it finds a match, it will warn the user that they are about to add a duplicate and save the day.

Forget about having to weed out duplicate listings with our easy to use solution. With just a few clicks, this add-on will show a warning notice to users when any of the enabled settings show a match with a current entry.

= Ajax Duplicate Alert fields =

Enabled or disabled any of the following fields to customize the checking process.
- Post Title
- Address
- Zip/Post Code
- Phone number
- Email address
- Website

Additionally, each field's error message can be customized individually or will fall back to a general warning message.
