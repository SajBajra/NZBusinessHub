With Custom Map Styles addon, you can customize map style to match the styling and color scheme of the maps with the rest of your site.

== Description ==

= Customize the look and feel of your maps! =

Now you can match the styling and color scheme of your Maps with the rest of your site! Our Custom Map Styles addon will give your website the brand recognition it deserves.

= Supports both Google Maps and Open Street Maps =

GeoDirectory supports both Google maps and OSM out the box, so, naturally, our addon works with both.

= For Google maps, you have the options to =

* Style all individual layers of the map such as roads, water, parks, railways, etc.
* Set Different styles for different types of maps. For example, style the details map different than the category maps.
* Modify style parameters such as hex color, hue, gamma, saturation, lightness, weight, and more.
* Import preset styles from Snazzy Maps and save a ton of time creating your own, use as-is or as a starting point for customization.

= For Open Street Maps, you have the options to =

* Set Different styles for different types of maps. For example, style the details map different than the category maps.
* Select from a wide range of preset map styles to match the style of your website or branding.
* API input to allow the use of paid maps layers such as Open Cycle Map layers or many others.

= Beautiful maps for your directory =

Map styles work with all GeoDirectory maps (apart from Google static maps which do not support styles). Likewise, all our addons, such as  Marker Cluster, are fully compatible. Whether you want to pretty up your maps or to add brand recognition to your site, our Custom Map Style addon has you covered.
