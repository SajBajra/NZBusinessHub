/**
 * Post Expired Message
 *
 * This template can be overridden by copying it to yourtheme/geodirectory/view/post-expired-text.php.
 *
 * HOWEVER, on occasion GeoDirectory will need to update template files and you
 * (the theme developer) will need to copy the new files to your theme to
 * maintain compatibility. We try to do this as little as possible, but it does
 * happen. When this occurs the version of the template file will be bumped and
 * the readme will list any important changes.
 *
 * @see        https://wpgeodirectory.com/documentation/article/how-tos/customizing-templates/
 * @package    GeoDir_Pricing_Manager
 * @version    2.6.0.0
