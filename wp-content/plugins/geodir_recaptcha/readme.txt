Integrates Google reCAPTCHA anti-spam methods with GeoDirectory addon including login, registration, comments, add listing, claim listing etc.

== Description ==

The GeoDirectory reCAPTCHA plugin allows you to implement a super security captcha form into GeoDirectory addon including registration, comments and claim listing forms. GeoDirectory reCAPTCHA is a free CAPTCHA service that protects your site against spam, malicious registrations and other forms of attacks where computers try to disguise themselves as a human.
This captcha can be used for GeoDirectory registration, comments, send to friend, send enquiry and claim listing forms.

GeoDirectory reCAPTCHA provides some of the smartest anti-spam security by protecting your site against spam and malicious registrations available today for WordPress, modded to be 100% GeoDirectory compatible.
